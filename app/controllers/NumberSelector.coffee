two horizontal histograms:
- zoomed in: a 500 number block that makes it easy to select a specific number and see the current number in context.
- zoomed out: a 1-10billion (or whatever) with a logarithmic scale.
   - TODO why logarithmic? Well, we kinda operate intuitively that way. I'm dealing with a huge # of #s.
     in a way this gives a macro level view of the numbers - vastly over simplified.
   - cons: its not intuitive to a lay persion I'd say. Its perhaps overly simplifying especially at high high values.
